My Emacs configuration.

=init.el= loads the basic configuration in =main.org= which in turn loads
modules that are slpit into smaller org files. =customize= related settings
(e.g., trusted local variables) are stored in =custom.el= and not under
version control.

Dependencies are either included via git's subtree functionality or installed
on start-up via regular ELPA functionality.
