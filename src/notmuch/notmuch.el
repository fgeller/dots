This buffer contains the results of a \"notmuch search\" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
thread giving a summary of the thread (a relative date, the
number of matched messages and total messages in the thread,
participants in the thread, a representative subject line, and
any tags).

Pressing \\[notmuch-search-show-thread] on any line displays that thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-add-tag]' and '\\[notmuch-search-remove-tag]'
keys can be used to add or remove tags from a thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-archive-thread]' key
is a convenience for archiving a thread (removing the \"inbox\"
tag). The '\\[notmuch-search-tag-all]' key can be used to add or remove a tag from all
threads in the current buffer.

Other useful commands are '\\[notmuch-search-filter]' for filtering the current search
based on an additional query string, '\\[notmuch-search-filter-by-tag]' for filtering to include
only messages with a given tag, and '\\[notmuch-search]' to execute a new, global
search.
