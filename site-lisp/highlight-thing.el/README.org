* highlight-thing.el

  Global minor mode to highlight a thing under point.

  Similar to =highlight-symbol-mode=, but does not rely on font-lock
  functionality and does not provide functionality to navigate to different
  occurrences of the current symbol under point.

  Uses =thingatpt= and =hi-lock= functionality that is included with GNU Emacs.

** Installation

   Basic setup:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'highlight-thing)
     (highlight-thing-mode)
   #+end_src

   The default is to highlight the symbol under point, but you can customize
   =hlt-what-thing= to highlight different components. Set the following to only
   highlight the word under point:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq hlt-what-thing 'word)
   #+end_src

   Customize the face =hi-yellow= to change the colors that are used for
   highlighting.
